							<p>Through the name DK Organics since 2015, we have introduced futuristic products formulated with botanical extracts. This is the result of our prestigious art of bridging technology (old techniques used with current sciences). Here is an example of one such product, "galic Sakthi plus," a stabilised extract of concentrated garlic. It contains stable biochemical properties such as allicin, selenium, polysulphide, carbs, vitamins, etc. Instead of being found in the aforementioned report, the contents have now been doubled in length. It can be used as a bridge between or as an addition to your current formulation of traditional pesticides. This includes granular and liquid insecticides, fungicides, weedicides, and soil treatments. There are many outlets and opportunities to market a new technology to combat sucking pests, nematodes, different types of fungi, and viral infections (as a pathostatic effect). Additionally, it contains additional components like selenium, carbohydrates, etc. Moreover, the target insect or disease doesn't develop a resistance to the specific chemicals since the carbohydrates draw them to the target insect or disease, which subdues them in a short period of time. Beyond all of the aforementioned, the product's standout feature is the reverse synthesis action that occurs in plants after usage for 20 days. Genetically, all poisons are removed from the plants, which results in higher crop yields. As a result, organic farming produces higher yields while also exhibiting improved taste, colour, aroma, firmness, and shelf life. As a result of the competition, it is likely to command a higher price in the market. The product's central excellence contributes to the provision of toxins-free, healthier food for both humans and animals. For more elaboration and enquiry samples kindly contact Us

											<p>Every gardener has to deal with pesky pests, but luckily there are many options for dealing with them. However, not every method will work for every pest, and gardeners who are dedicated to organic gardening may have a difficult time finding options that work for them. One interesting trend in organic pest control is garlic. That’s right, garlic doesn’t just keep vampires at bay, but pests as well! What pests does garlic keep away from, and how does it work?

										The ingestion of garlic causes conditions called hemolytic anemia, Heinz body anemia, and methemoglobinemia which are all manifestations of damage to red blood cells. Essentially, the compounds in garlic can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet's body to become very fragile and burst.
										</p>
										<p>Garlic can even deter gnawing pests like deer and rabbits. Garlic is a great plant to have in your garden, although there are a few plants that should keep their distance. And best of all, it is not picky. It adapts well to all soils and all conditions provided there is plenty of sun.

										<blockquote className="quote"><p>The herb Allium sativum, commonly known as "garlic", has long been considered an antibacterial agent that inhibits the growth of infectious organisms while protecting the body from them. This study was conducted to determine the antibacterial activity of soap from garlic extract using the paperdisc method and Kirby-Bauer bacteria sensitivity test against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, and to determine the physical properties of garlic soap and the presence of saponin through phytochemical screening. Garlic soap showed antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Mean zone of inhibition was numerically higher in plate extract obtained using garlic soap (14.70mm-18mm), compared to commercial soap. Results of phytochemical screening revealed that the extract from garlic contains saponin, which is a crucial ingredient for making soap. Physical properties showed unpleasant odor, dirty white color, smooth texture and pH range of 6.5-7.5. Further studies are needed to determine the potential of garlic soap in other strains of bacteria.
